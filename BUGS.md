# Bug reports


The engine still being in development, bugs are a frequent thing. They might appear after a new feature implementation, or just by fixing another bug. 
Uniray has a bug nomenclature similar to Minecraft's. They are named after their field of application in the engine, and their order of discovery. If
you want to report a bug to the administrator, please make sure to take account of what already exists to name it correctly. You will find below a list 
of every field of application and their corresponding acronym.

## List of acronyms

- `UT` - Uniray-Three-Dimension
    : Relative to the 3D rendering of the application
- `UU` - Uniray-UI
    : Relative to the 2D UI of the application (e.g buttons, textboxes, etc.)
- `UB` - Uniray-Build
    : Relative to the build of the application 
- `UP` - Uniray-Project
    : Relative to the project managment of the application

The above acronyms represent the main categorys present in the engine.
